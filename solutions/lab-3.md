# Solution: Lab 3 — Plan: Create the Implementation Plan

## Step-by-step Solution

1. **Outline the plan**
	 - Example:
		 - Server: Node.js (Express)
		 - Client: TypeScript (fetch-based)
		 - API Spec: OpenAPI 3.0 (YAML)
	 - Plan integration:
		 - Use Spec Kit to generate server/client stubs from `specs/orders.spec.yaml`.
		 - Integrate server code into backend repo, client code into frontend repo.
	 - Dependencies:
		 - Docker running for code generation.
		 - Node.js and TypeScript installed.
2. **Document the plan**
	 - Save as `plan.md` in your project.
3. **Review and update**
	 - Review with your team and update as needed.

## Expected Outcome
- `plan.md` exists, reviewed and actionable.
