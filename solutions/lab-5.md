# Solution: Lab 5 — Implement: Generate API Spec, Client, and Server

## Step-by-step Solution

1. **Generate artifacts**
	- (If supported) Run code generation (e.g., `spec-kit generate` or similar commands).
	- If not available, document the manual process or use another tool.
2. **Integrate artifacts**
	- Add generated server code to backend repo.
	- Add generated client code to frontend repo.
3. **Test and review**
	- Test generated code for correctness.
	- Review artifacts for completeness.
4. **Document issues**
	- Note any problems or improvements needed.

## Expected Outcome
- API spec, client, and server artifacts are generated, integrated, and reviewed.
