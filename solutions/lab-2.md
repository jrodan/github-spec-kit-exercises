# Solution: Lab 2 — Specify: Define Business Specification and Prepare for Generation

## Step-by-step Solution

1. **Capture business requirements**
	- Create `specs/orders.requirements.md` with:
	  ```markdown
	  # Orders API — Business Requirements
	  - The API must allow listing all orders for an online shop.
	  - Each order must have an ID and an amount.
	  - Only authenticated users can access their own orders (future requirement).
	  - The API should be extensible to support order status and filtering by date.
	  ```
2. **Review and commit**
	- Review the file with your team (refer to your Constitution).
	- Commit the requirements file to version control.

## Expected Outcome
- `specs/orders.requirements.md` exists, reviewed and committed.
- Ready to generate API, client, and server artifacts.
