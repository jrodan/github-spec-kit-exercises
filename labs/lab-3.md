# Context
**Spec Kit Phase:** /speckit.plan (Plan)
**Learning Goal:** Create a technical implementation plan for the API, including how to generate and integrate API, client, and server artifacts.



# Lab 3 — Plan: Create the Implementation Plan

Estimated time: 8–10 minutes

Goal
----
Create a technical implementation plan for the Orders API, including how you will generate and integrate API, client, and server artifacts.

Steps
-----
1. Use Spec Kit's planning features (or document manually) to outline:
   - Which tech stack(s) will be used for the client and server.
   - How the generated artifacts will be integrated into your workflow.
   - Any dependencies or prerequisites for generation and integration.
2. Document your plan in a file (e.g., `plan.md`) in your project.
3. Review the plan with your team and update as needed.
4. **Hint:** Always review the generated artifacts and update your plan if needed after generation.

Expected outcome
----------------
- You have a clear, actionable implementation plan for generating and integrating the Orders API artifacts.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If unsure about tech stack or integration, discuss with your team or consult documentation.
