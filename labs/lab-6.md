# Context
**Spec Kit Phase:** All Phases (Iterative Change)
**Learning Goal:** Practice evolving the API by adding an attribute and iterating through all Spec Kit phases to implement and review the change.

# Lab 6 — Evolve: Update the API and Iterate Through All Phases

Estimated time: 12–18 minutes

Goal
----
Practice evolving the Orders API by adding a new attribute, and iterate through all Spec Kit phases to implement and review the change.

Steps
-----
1. **Constitution:**
   - Review and update `.specify/memory/constitution.md` if governance or review rules need to change for this update.
2. **Specify:**
   - Update `specs/orders.requirements.md` to include the new business requirement (e.g., add an order status attribute).
   - Update `specs/orders.spec.yaml` to add the new attribute (e.g., `status`).
3. **Plan:**
   - Update your implementation plan (`plan.md`) to reflect the change and any new integration or testing steps.
4. **Tasks:**
   - Update your task list (`tasks.md`) to include steps for updating, generating, and integrating the new attribute.
5. **Implement:**
   - Regenerate the API spec, client, and server artifacts.
   - Integrate and test the updated artifacts.
   - Review all generated artifacts for correctness and completeness.
6. **Communicate:**
   - Document the change and communicate it to all stakeholders (e.g., changelog, PR, meeting).

Expected outcome
----------------
- The API, client, and server have been updated to support the new attribute, and all phases have been iterated and reviewed.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If you encounter issues, review each phase and ensure all artifacts and documentation are updated.
