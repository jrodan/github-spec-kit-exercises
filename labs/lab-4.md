Estimated time: 8–10 minutes

Goal
----
Generate actionable task lists for implementing the Orders API, client, and server, and plan integration steps.

Steps
-----
1. Use Spec Kit's task generation features (or document manually) to create a list of actionable tasks for:
	- Generating the API spec, client, and server artifacts.
	- Integrating these artifacts into your consumer/provider project.
	- Testing and reviewing the generated artifacts.
2. Document your task list in a file (e.g., `tasks.md`) in your project.
3. Review the tasks with your team and update as needed.
4. **Hint:** Always review the generated artifacts after each major step.

Expected outcome
----------------
- You have a clear, actionable task list for implementing and integrating the Orders API artifacts.

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If unsure about tasks or integration, discuss with your team or consult documentation.
